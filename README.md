This is a Dockerized version of the [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/) dedicated server.

## How to use

Keep in mind that you'll need to change the [environment variables](##Environment-variables).

### Docker Compose

This repository includes an example [docker-compose.yml](example/docker-compose.yml) file you can use to setup your server.

```yml
services:
   palworld:
      image: thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker
      restart: unless-stopped
      container_name: palworld-server
      ports:
        - 8211:8211/udp
        - 27015:27015/udp
      environment:
         - PORT=8211
         - PLAYERS=16
         - MULTITHREADING=FALSE
         - COMMUNITY=false  # Enable this if you want your server to show up in the community servers tab, USE WITH SERVER_PASSWORD!
         # Enable the environment variables below if you have COMMUNITY=true
         # - SERVER_PASSWORD="worldofpals"
         # - SERVER_NAME="World of Pals"
         # - ADMIN_PASSWORD="someAdminPassword"
      volumes:
         - /path/to/your/palworld/folder:/palworld/
```

### Docker Run

Change every <> to your own configuration

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name palworld-server \
    -p 8211:8211/udp \
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -v ./<palworld-folder>:/palworld/ \
    -e PLAYERS=16 \
    -e PORT=8211 \
    -e COMMUNITY=false \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker

```

### Environment variables

You can use the following values to change the settings of the server on boot.
It is highly recommended you set the following environment values before starting the server:

* PLAYERS
* PORT
* MULTITHREADING
